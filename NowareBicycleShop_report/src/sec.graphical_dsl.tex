\section{Graphical DSL using GMF}
\label{sec.gmf}

\noindent The Graphical Modeling Framework makes it possible to provide a 
graphical visualization of the model through a graphical editor. 
The user is shown a canvas where elements of the model can be dragged 
and dropped from the palette. This is a more intuitive way to interact 
with the system for customers of NBS.\\
\noindent At this point there are two ways to create a new bicycle model. 
Either by creating a tree based editor where the user has to add 
parts of the bike as children to the Bicycle node. The second option 
is by using the GMF Editor where the user selects the part (which also 
has an appropriate icon) on the palette and drops it on the canvas.
There are no connections between the certain parts of the bicycle, 
because they can be placed in any order and different bicycles might 
have different amount of parts.\\
\noindent The user has the possibility to change the name of a part but changing 
the price for obvious reasons is only possible in the Properties view. 
For that reason in the final implementation the Properties view should 
not be shown to the customer. The OCL Constraints as mentioned earlier 
are implemented in GMF, specifically in the gmfmap as Audit Rules.
The errors are shown as in the Figure \ref{fig.gmf_validation}\\
\noindent Feature initializers were not part of the implementation, however
would be possible to use them. Every new bicycle model could have the
frame, a wheel and pedals on creation, since these parts are essential for every
bicycle. //TODO How?
\noindent Since we don't have links in our project we can't use modeling (link) constraints
