\section{Graphical DSL using GMF}
\label{sec.gmf}

\noindent \emph{GMF} is a framework for
building modeling-like graphical Eclipse-based editors.
\cite{Article_Introducing_GMF} GMF supports the generation of a graphical editor
from a set of models. In this section we will present the important
milestones of creating a graphical editor and why were they necessary. 

\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Graphical Definition Model}\\
  \noindent Used to define graphical elements (figures, nodes, links) which will
  be displayed in the editor.
  \item \emph{Tooling Definition Model}\\
  \noindent Used to specify the palette, creation tools and actions for the
  graphical elements.
  \item \emph{Mapping Model}\\
  \noindent It is combined of the three previously
created definition models (domain, graphical and tooling). It provides the input
for the transfor- mation step. The OCL Constraints are implemented in the Mapping Model as Audit Rules.
  \item \emph{Diagram Generation Model}\\
  \noindent It is transformed from the three previous models. This model
is used for generating the code for the graphical editor. It is similar to the EMF Generation
Model, mentioned earlier. \cite{GMF_Tutorial}  
\end{itemize}

\noindent Having all the required models it is possible to generate the code
necessary for a running diagram editor. When the user creates a new NBS diagram he is
shown a canvas where elements of the model can be dragged and dropped from the
palette. There are no connections between the certain parts
of the bicycle, because they can be placed in any order and different bicycles
might have different amount of parts. \\

\noindent The user has the possibility to change the name of a part but changing
the price is not allowed in the canvas. It is only possible to change the
price in the Properties view. For that reason the Properties view should not be
shown to the customer in the final implementation.  
Validation error examples are shown in Figure \ref{fig.gmf_validation}.\\

\noindent Feature initializers were not a part of the implementation, however
they could be useful. Every new bicycle model could have additional parameters
with name and value set added on the initialization. For instance, this could be
a new parameter named 'Telephone Number' having an empty default value.\\
Modeling link constraints were neither part of implementation, since we do
not use links in the project. Nonetheless, it is a useful feature that allows
to constrain users from linking objects together. \\
