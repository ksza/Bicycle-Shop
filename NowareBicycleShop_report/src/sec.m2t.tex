\section{Model to Text Transformation using XPand}
\label{sec.m2t}
\noindent In the implementation of NBS, we enable the possibility of
generating an invoice for a custom bicycle. The invoice will contain the
customer details, delivery date, the total price, a detailed
list of the bicycle parts and additional parameters. In
order to achieve this functionality we have implemented a transformation from a
bicycle model to a textual representation in the \emph{HTML} format. The
feature is accessible from the graphical editor. When the user has finished
creating the bicycle and would like to finalize the order, he can invoke the
contextual menu on the bicycle diagram and select the option ``Edit/Duplicate''. This will generate the current configuration invoice and open it in a browser. The above described scenario is depicted in figure \ref{fig.xpand.usecase}. The
code for the extensions template is shown in appendix
\ref{appendix.xpand.implementation}.\\

\noindent To implement the M2T Transformation, we have used \emph{XPand}. We
have implemented the templates in the same project with the EMF model. To be able to
do this, the first step was to enable the Xtent/Xpand nature on the model
project. Afterwards, we defined the two template files, \emph{Extensions.ext}
and \emph{InvoiceTemplate.xpt}, in the \emph{model/template} package. This way
both templates are able to import and work with the \emph{nowarebicycleshop}
model. Figure \ref{fig.xpand.model_xpand_invoice} illustrates the
InvoiceTemplate file and the resulting invoice a M2T transformation applied to
the presented concrete model.\\

\noindent \emph{Extensions.ext} is an Xtent template which defines three utility
methods for the Xpand template: \emph{getTitle()} which creates the file name
for the invoice, \emph{getDocumentHeader()} to crate the HTML header and
\emph{getDocumentFooter} to create the HTML footer. \emph{InvoiceTemplate.xpt}
is a Xpand template where we define the actual transformation from the custom
bicycle model to an invoice represented as HTML. In the template file we define
two templates: \emph{main} and \emph{part}. The main template creates the file
with the name provided by the \emph{getTitle()} method in the extension and
fills it with the followings:
\begin{itemize}
  \item document header provided by \emph{getDocumentHeader()}
  \item customer name, address, delivery date and total price
  \item for each part in the bicycle model, calls the \emph{part} template
  filling in information regarding each bicycle part
  \item document footer provided by \emph{getDocumentFooter}
\end{itemize}\\

\noindent After implementing the templates, we have created the
\emph{dk.itu.mdd.nbs.diagram.custom} plug-in as a GMF extension point, in order
to get notified when an edit action occurs on the \emph{bicycle diagram}. The
functionality is implemented in the \emph{EditPolicyProvider} and
\emph{OpenEditPolicy} classes. The code and relevant comments are shown in
appendix \ref{appendix.xpand.implementation}. When the \emph{DuplicateRequest} request command is received,
the following actions are taken to fulfill the transformation:
\begin{itemize}
  \item get the Bicycle instance under the edited diagram
  \item configure the outlet to be used by the generator
  \item create an execution context for the XPand and XTend programmatic
  execution
  \item create the execution context based on our custom Outlet and
  mocked variables map
  \item create a mock EMFRegistry to contain our meta-model and the
  ecore meta-model
  \item register the mock registry in the execution context
  \item launch the M2T transformation using the \emph{XpandFacade} class
  \item show the invoice in an external browser
\end{itemize}\\

\noindent We have gained deeper technical background about Xtent/Xpand from
\cite{XPAND_EXAMPLE}.
