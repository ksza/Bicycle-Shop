\section{Introduction}
\label{sec.introduction}
\noindent The assignment is about creating an IT system for a fictive bicycle
shop called \emph{Noware Bicycle Shop} (NBS), which specializes in selling
customized handmade bicycles and have been in business for several years as an
old-fashioned, physical shop. The main problem they are having is that it is
difficult to demonstrate the possibilities of customizing bicycles for the
customers just through magazines and catalogs. Secondly, the sales clerks spend
a great amount of their time on supporting customers to choose valid
configurations for their bikes. To alleviate the work of sales clerks and make
it easier for the customers to customize bikes, NBS would like to introduce an
IT solution with touch screen terminals where customers can easily create their
model of new bikes. The clerks will make use of a textual interface to rapidly
create bike configurations.

\subsection{Motivation}
\noindent Our group's motivation for creating this task is to use the modeling
concepts learned through the Model Driven Development (MDD) lectures and apply
it on a realistic scenario. By completing the assignments the members will
have a better idea of how MDD can be used to model a physical shop, apply its
terms in an IT environment and speed up the development process of the system.

\subsection{The Process}
\noindent As the aim is to achieve a flexible and effective solution, we have
adopted a model driven development approach, which helps in capturing domain
knowledge described in terms of a \emph{Domain Specific Language} (DSL). 
In the remainder of this section we will briefly describe
our approach, relating to the main tasks we carried out:
\begin{itemize}
  \item construction of a conceptual data model to represent a bicycle
  \item construction and implementation of a logical model as an
  \emph{EMF}\footnote{Eclipse Modeling Framework} model to represent a single
  customized bicycle, to be delivered to a single customer 
  \item definition of \emph{OCL}\footnote{Object Constraint Language}
  constraints
  \item development of a \emph{GMF}\footnote{Graphical Modeling Framework} based
  \emph{graphical DSL} for customers
  \item development of an \emph{XText}\footnote{a Language Development
  Framework} based \emph{textual editor} for sales clerks
  \item creation of a \emph{M2T}\footnote{model to text} transformation using
  Xpand\footnote{a language specialized on code generation based on EMF models}
  to create a textural invoice that summarizes the custom bike's configuration
\end{itemize} 

\noindent The report starts by describing the problem, the
motivation and the steps we have taken. Section \ref{sec.logical_model}
presents the way we have defined and implemented our models. Section
\ref{sec.ocl_constraints} presents the implementation of OCL constraints in the
model. Section \ref{sec.gmf} describes how we achieved the graphical syntax.
Section \ref{sec.xtext} presents the usage of XText in order to achieve textual
syntax. Section \ref{sec.m2t} describes the model to text transformation.
Finally, section \ref{sec.conclusions} concludes our work.
