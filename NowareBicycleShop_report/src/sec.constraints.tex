\section{OCL Constraints}
\label{sec.ocl_constraints}

\noindent \emph{Noware Bicycle Shop} (NBS) must provide rules to ensure that
only valid bikes are modeled and ordered by customers. To accomplish this, a 
set of constraints were implemented in the \emph{Ecore} meta-model using \emph{OCL}.\\

\noindent The list of textual constraints and their definitions in OCL are
shown in the appendix \ref{appendix.ocl_constraints}. All constraints were
implemented as invariants in the \emph{Ecore} model. Each invariant was given
a name for the ease of reference. The invariants specify the valid sets
of parts for the Bicycle model. OCL constraints are executed in the runtime
workbench on newly created models. Examples of validation errors are shown in
figure \ref{fig.ocl_bike_errors} and \ref{fig.ocl_ecore_handbreaks}.\\

\noindent When progressing with the project, we have moved the OCL constraints
from the \emph{Ecore} model into \emph{GMF}, implementing them as \emph{AuditRules}. This allows restricting customers from modeling invalid bikes in the \emph{GMF} diagrameditor, as well as displaying validations with user-friendlymessages.\\
