\section{OCL Constraints}
\label{sec.ocl_constraints}

\noindent 
\emph{Noware Bicycle Shop} (NBS) must provide rules to ensure that
only valid bikes are modeled and ordered by customers. To accomplish this, a full
set of constraints were implemented in the \emph{Ecore} meta-model using the
\emph{OCL}.\\

\noindent
A list of textual constraints and their definitions in OCL expressions are shown
in the Appendix Figure \ref{appendix.validation}. All constraints were implemented as invariants using
generated Java code (nbs.ecore) for the Bicycle object. Each invariant was given
a name for the ease of referrence. These invariants specify the valid sets
of parts for the Bicycle model. OCL constraints are executed in the runtime
workbench on newly created models. Examples of validation errors are shown in the Appendix Figure
\ref{fig.ocl_bike_errors}, \ref{fig.ocl_ecore_handbreaks}.\\

\noindent 
When progressing with the project, we have moved the OCL constraints from the
\emph{Ecore} meta-model to the \emph{GMF} Audit Rules. This still allows torestrict the customers from modelling invalid bikes in the \emph{GMF} Diagrameditor. However, it also enables displaying validations with user-friendlymasseges.
