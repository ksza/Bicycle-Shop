\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec.conclusions}

\noindent  The aim of this work was to create an IT solution for 
Noware Bicycle Shop, which will run on the terminals with touch screens 
and provide a possibility for customers to customize bike themselves 
in the shop and provide a textual editor for sales clerks to enter bike
configurations easily. As a result were created:
\begin{itemize} 
  \item The conceptual model for defining the main concepts of a bicycle
  \item The logical (EMF) model for representing a single customized bicycle
  \item The set of OCL statements as constraints on the model
  \item The textual editor (based on XText) to define a custom bicycle by the
  sales clerks.
  \item The graphical editor (based on GMF) to define a custom bicycle by the
  customers on the touch screens (with a validation to ensure that only valid 
  bicycles can be represented).
  \item The transformation (using XPand) of a custom bicycle model into a 
  textual invoice (HTML) which lists the bike properties and customer data 
  and can be given to the customer and documented for accounting.
\end{itemize}
During the work the aim was achieved and represents the complete application for NBS.
