\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec.conclusions}
\noindent By carrying out all the tasks, we gained valuable knowledge about the
model driven development approach. We managed to satisfy the needs, of creating
and ordering custom bicycles, of both the sales clerk, providing a textual
editor, and the customer, providing a rich-featured graphical editor. We could
offer a more customized GMF model in order to make it more user-friendly. Also,
we could add a \emph{total price} label to the diagram so that the user can
interactively see the total price, not just in the invoice. We have also managed
to implement a model to text transformation for any custom model in the runtime
environment by programatically invoking the \emph{XPand} template transformation,
which offered us more insights in the M2T transformation technologies. In
conclusion, by completing this project we have mastered the concepts and
technologies present during the lectures, helping us think at a higher level of
abstraction design our software using a \emph{model driven} approach.
