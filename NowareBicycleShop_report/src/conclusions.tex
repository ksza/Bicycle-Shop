\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec.conclusions}
\noindent By carrying out all the tasks, we gained valuable knowledge about
the model driven development approach. We managed to satisfy the needs of creating
and ordering custom bicycles, of both the sales clerk, providing a textual
editor, and the customer, providing a rich-featured graphical editor. We could
offer a more customized GMF model in order to make it more user-friendly. Also,
we could add a \emph{total price} label to the diagram so that the user can
interactively see the total price in the editor, not just in the invoice. We
have also managed to implement a model to text transformation for any custom model in the runtime
environment by programmatically invoking the \emph{XPand} template
transformation and that gave us more insight into the M2T transformation technologies. In
conclusion, by completing this project, we have mastered the concepts and
technologies presented during the lectures, helping us to think at a higher
level of abstraction and design our software using a \emph{model driven}
approach.
