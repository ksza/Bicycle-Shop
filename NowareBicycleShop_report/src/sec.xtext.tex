\section{Textual DSL using XText}
\label{sec.xtext}

\noindent
Defining bicycle models textually helps the sales clerks to 
speed up the creation of bicycle models. In this manner clerks 
can create models can be created by copying, eventually editing 
an already existing model. When creating models from scratch 
the editor provides code completion so the user does not have to 
type full words or can get help what parts are left to define.\\
The grammar we have developed was meant to be as simple
so it is fast to enter while keeping it perspicuous. There are no
brackets needed for separating elements which further simplifies 
the layout. The keywords and class names are differentiated with 
syntaxt highlighting as standard Java code. 
The Xtext Grammar is listed in Figure \ref{appendix.xtext}.\\
Syntax checking example in Figure \ref{fig.dsl_empty_model}.\\
Autocomplete examples in Figures \ref{fig.dsl_autocomplete_parts},
\ref{fig.dsl_autocomplete_values}.\\
