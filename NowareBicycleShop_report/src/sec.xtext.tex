\section{Textual DSL using XText}
\label{sec.xtext}

\noindent
To help the sales clerk in their everyday tasks we have developed a textual DSL
using \emph{XText} framework. A textual language can speed up the process of
creating bicycle models and user data. Because of the nature of text files,
sales clerk can easily copy and edit already created model instances.\\

\noindent
We have used an Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF)
metalanguage notations to describe a textual DSL. Our textual DSL is external,
meanig that it is new, not extending an existing language. As we have identified the entities,
attributes and relations in the \emph{Ecore} meta-model, we use
\emph{XText} to generate the textual DSL. It creates a grammar with rules for
our entities, abstract types, propteries, relations, etc. We build upon this grammar and modify it for our needs. The final \emph{XText} grammar definition is listed in Figure
\ref{appendix.xtext}. It is extendible and context-free.\\

\noindent
The target user for the language is the sales clerk and he might not
have any programming experience, so we want the language to seem
natural. Therefore statement terminators, such as symbols or line feeds, are not
used. The grammar is rich, having types for entities, attribute
names, enumerators and other details. This is used to provide context assistance
in the tools.\\

\noindent
When using the textual DSL, the editor executes syntax checking (Figure
\ref{fig.dsl_empty_model}) and suggests code completion (Figures \ref{fig.dsl_autocomplete_parts},
\ref{fig.dsl_autocomplete_values}). The user also gets help on what parts
are left to define. The grammar is simple and fast to enter while keeping it
perspicuous. Excluding separators from the grammar further simplifies the layout.
Moreover, the keywords and class names are differentiated with syntax
highlighting.\\
